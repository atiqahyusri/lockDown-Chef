# lockDown-Chef
This is a mobile application project. We use android studio to build this project. Lockdown chef is a project to help people what to cook during the lockdown. 
The flow is, user register and login to this app, they can view any recipe they want, they may click to the recipe and enter how many people want to eat, 
and all ingredient in that recipe will change according to a number of servers. They also can like the recipe. Other than that, they can upload their cooking 
video as well.
